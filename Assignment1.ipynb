      "With a crime rate of 31 per one thousand residents, Fort Worth has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 32. Within Texas, more than 93% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Fort Worth.\n",
      "However, compared to other communities of similar population size, Fort Worth has a crime rate that is noticeably lower than the average. This means that for comparably sized cities all across America, Fort Worth is actually safer than most according to NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis of FBI crime data.\n",
      "Now let us turn to take a look at how Fort Worth does for violent crimes specifically, and then how it does for property crimes. This is important because the overall crime rate can be further illuminated by understanding if violent crime or property crimes (or both) are the major contributors to the general rate of crime in Fort Worth.\n",
      "From our analysis, we discovered that violent crime in Fort Worth occurs at a rate higher than in most communities of all population sizes in America. The chance that a person will become a victim of a violent crime in Fort Worth; such as armed robbery, aggravated assault, rape or murder; is 1 in 205. This equates to a rate of 5 per one thousand inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, NeighborhoodScout found that a lot of the crime that takes place in Fort Worth is property crime. Property crimes that are tracked for this analysis are burglary, larceny over fifty dollars, motor vehicle theft, and arson. In Fort Worth, your chance of becoming a victim of a property crime is one in 38, which is a rate of 26 per one thousand population.\n",
      "Importantly, we found that Fort Worth has one of the highest rates of motor vehicle theft in the nation according to our analysis of FBI crime data. This is compared to communities of all sizes, from the smallest to the largest. In fact, your chance of getting your car stolen if you live in Fort Worth is one in 204.\n",
      "NeighborhoodScout® provides exclusive crime risk analytics for every neighborhood in America with up to 98% predictive accuracy. Crime risk indices are nationally comparable on a 1 – 100 scale, where 100 means safer than 100% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n",
      "Crime risk data are updated annually. Raw crime incidents are sourced from all 18,000+ local law enforcement agencies – municipal, county, transit, park, port, university, tribal and more, assigned to localities, then built into NeighborhoodScout’s proprietary predictive models to provide a comprehensive crime risk profile for every neighborhood and address-vicinity in the U.S.\n",
